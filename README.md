This is the repository for Toy Takeover. A game made by Sugar Glider Games as part of a group project at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment.

# How to Play
## THE BASICS:
Timmy’s parents have bought him new toys. Fakes, knock offs, copies, impersonators. Fight back, save your batteries, soldier.

There are 6 waves total. Each wave gets progressively more difficult as you go on, as the enemies become more plentiful. But hang in there, and you’ll reach the end eventually!

To survive these waves, you've been given 3 weapons and a Jetpack. There are a total of 2 enemies and 1 environmental hazard to look out for. You'll also find useful items throughout the play area. Keep reading to learn more!

## WEAPONS:
You’ve been given 3 weapons, each using the highest grade plastic the toybox has to offer!

### Crossbow:
This high power weapon may seem slow, 
but can pack quite the punch if you 
can land a shot with it!

### Splash! Water Blaster:
This automatic blaster will shoot continuous drops of water at your targets. Although its
mid-tier damage rate may make it seem
less reliable than other weapons, it can 
be an excellent tool for taking out waves
of enemies!

### Laser Gun:
Don’t let its low damage fool you. This
weapon is great for dealing with enemies 
at a long distance, its high ammo
capacity makes it a reliable and strong 
tool in the right situation!


### JETPACK:
You’ve been equipped with a jetpack, one of the highest power accessories in the toybox! This will let you fly in the air and even let you glide down safely. 
However, keep in mind that you’ll need to
keep the jetpack fueled up! If you run out
of fuel, you won’t be able to use the
jetpack until you replenish your tank, so
keep on the lookout!


## ENEMIES:

### Grunt:
They may seem weak individually, but as
a team, they can prove to be quite a
handful! These toys will follow you on sight
and will attack you with their crowbar.

### Robot:
The biggest of the bunch, these will aim
and fire their weapon at you on sight.
Keep an ear out for these, you do not
want to get hit by one of their bullets!


## ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD:

### Car:
While moving your way around the play area, keep on the lookout for these speedy obstacles! They’ll travel around a set track, and will deal some
serious damage on impact! These
don’t count towards the number of
enemies in a wave, will always 
respawn, and also cannot be destroyed! Keep on the lookout, they have a tendency to creep up on you!


## PICKUPS:
At the beginning of each wave, you’ll get a fresh set of pickups that you will be able to find all around the play area.

### Health:
If your battery health is running low, don’t
worry! You can find more battery health
around the play area!

### Armour:
These will give you a little bit of extra
strength. Great if you need an extra 
boost!

### Jetpack fuel:
Refills half of your jetpack fuel.

### Ammo:
Separate ammo for each of your weapons!

## WRAPPING UP:
But that’s not all! On top of all that, there is also a timer, which will keep track of how long it takes you to complete all the waves. Once you’ve completed all the waves, take note of your time and try and beat it, see how fast you can go, and most importantly… Have fun!
